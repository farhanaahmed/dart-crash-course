//This type of code is usually not okay simply because weâ€™d be asking ourselves why are we returning a function 
//from this function when we could just return the result. 
//Well, the reason for it was to demonstrate that we can do that.

//In some true examples of where we might need this, 
//we truly may be thinking well there is no other option and this is how it should work.
